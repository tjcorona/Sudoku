Sudoku

This is a simple project for generating and solving Sudoku puzzles,
and for profiling the puzzle generator.  Basically, I wanted to learn
more about the Dancing Links algorithm
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_Links).  The puzzles are scored
based on a couple of metrics defined in Paper_3485.pdf, a paper I
found.  In order to keep the dependency list to nil, I have
successfully harnessed the awesome power of ASCII art for the Sudoku
board and profile histograms.
